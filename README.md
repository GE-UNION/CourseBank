# DTU Course Bank Library
Here we keep all files for the [GE UNION course bank](https://geunion.dk/courses/) hosted and organised.

All folders must reflect the spelling and format of the website.</br>
All filenames must be in the format: `{filename}-a-{author}`, with '_' instead of spaces and no special characters.</br>
Examples:
* `Physics_equations-a-Andrew_Davison`
* `Statistics_test_calculator_scripts-a-s24...`
* `Atomic_electron_geometries` (author is optional)

Whenever this repository is updated, the `structure.json` file is regenerated and the changes are immeiately visible on the website.
